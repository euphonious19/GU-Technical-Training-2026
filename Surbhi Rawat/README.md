# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) 

This repository contains implementations and solutions for common *Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), focusing on **Array* and *Linked List* problems as of now, commonly used in technical interviews and competitive programming.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Features:
- *Array Operations*: Implementations for array manipulation, searching, and sorting.
- *Linked List Operations*: Implementations for singly and doubly linked lists, including insertions, deletions, and traversals.
- *Code Efficiency*: Focus on optimizing solutions and writing clean, reusable code.
- *Techniques Covered*:
  - Searching algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
  - Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort)
  - Linked List operations (Insertion, Deletion, Traversal)
  - Other DSA-related problems like reversing an array, finding duplicates, etc.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack:
- *Language*:Java
- *IDE/Editor*:IntelliJ IDEA 
- *Version Control*: Git (for maintaining code history)

## ðŸ”¢ Array & Linked List DSA Operations:

### *Array Operations:*
1. *Insertion*: Add an element at a specific position.
2. *Deletion*: Remove an element at a specified index.
3. *Traversal*: Traverse through the array to access elements.
4. *Searching*: Linear search and binary search for element lookup.
5. *Sorting*: Bubble sort, selection sort, and merge sort algorithms.

### *Linked List Operations:*
1. *Singly Linked List*:
   - Insertion at the beginning, middle, and end.
   - Deletion from the beginning, middle, and end.
   - Traversing the list.
2. *Doubly Linked List*:
   - Insertion and deletion with references to both previous and next nodes.
   - Traversing in both directions.
3. *Reversal*: Reverse the linked list.
4. *Detecting Loops*: Algorithm to detect loops in a linked list.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Code:

1. *Clone the repository:*
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SurbhiiRawat/DSA-Arrays-LinkedList.git
